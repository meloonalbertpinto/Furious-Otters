# Furious Otters â€“ Predictive AI for Environmental Risk & Disaster Response

A next-gen solution built for Hackfest25 under the Sustainable Development (DEMETER) track. This project focuses on leveraging AI and real-time data systems to address critical challenges in climate action and disaster risk reduction.

## Project Overview

We're developing an integrated system architecture that brings together IoT, machine learning, and GIS to:

- Predict and manage environmental risks (e.g., floods, pollution, heatwaves)
- Provide early disaster warnings
- Monitor air quality and pollution in real-time
- Enable climate forecasting to support agriculture
- Assist in disaster resource allocation
- Analyze the impact of climate on public health

## Architecture Highlights

- **Data Collection**: Satellite feeds, weather APIs, and IoT sensors (air quality, water levels, temperature).
- **Analytics Engine**: Machine learning models for risk prediction and automated alert generation.
- **Visualization Layer**: Real-time interactive maps, heatmaps, and high-risk zone identification.
- **User Interface**: Web and mobile platforms for both authorities and citizens.
- **Backend System**: Scalable backend with secure databases and API integration.

## Technical Focus Areas
